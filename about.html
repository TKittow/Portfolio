        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have diverse experience spanning from marketing to recruitment and eventually transitioning into the tech industry, where I worked as an IT Technician for over a year. </p>

        <p>I decided to become a Software Engineer after learning and practicing in my free time and after work. I quickly became enthralled with the creative problem-solving required in coding. I am deeply passionate about learning and take pride in my achievements.</p> 
            
        <p>I am seeking a role that challenges me intellectually and fosters innovation in a collaborative environment where I can bring my diverse background and skills to grow professionally.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>Although my interest in software development was fostered at a young age</p>
        <p>I worked as a recruiter for CNC and Lathe operators in America in 2021 which really began my software journey in earnest.</p>
        <p>I left my position when I moved to london and started learning software development in my free time whilst bartending.</p>
        <p>In an effort to gain some experience in the industry I applied and became an IT Technician. This really helped me continue my studies and ultimately lead to my starting a software engineering course at General Assembly.</p>
