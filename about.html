        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="aboutText">
            <p>I have diverse experience spanning from marketing to recruitment and eventually transitioning into the tech industry, where I worked as an IT Technician for over a year. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I decided to become a Software Engineer after learning and practicing in my free time and after work. I quickly became enthralled with the creative problem-solving required in coding. I am deeply passionate about learning and take pride in my achievements.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>I am seeking a role that challenges me intellectually and fosters innovation in a collaborative environment where I can bring my diverse background and skills to grow professionally.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <div class="aboutText">
            <p>Although my interest in software development was fostered at a young age, I did not follow through with studying until I got older.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I worked as a recruiter for CNC and Lathe operators in America in 2021 which really began my software engineering journey in earnest.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I left my position when I moved to london and started learning software development in my free time whilst bartending.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In an effort to gain some experience in the industry I applied and became an IT Technician. This really helped me continue my studies and ultimately lead to my starting a software engineering course at General Assembly.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I relished the opportunity to turn my passion into a marketable skill and am now looking to continue to learn and grow as a software developer.</p>
