    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I have diverse experience spanning from marketing to recruitment and eventually transitioning into the tech industry, where I worked as an IT Technician for over a year.

        I decided to become a Software Engineer after learning and practicing in my free time and after work. I quickly became enthralled with the creative problem-solving required in coding. I am deeply passionate about learning and take pride in my achievements. 
        
        I am seeking a role that challenges me intellectually and fosters innovation in a collaborative environment where I can bring my diverse background and skills to grow professionally.</p>
